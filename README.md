# Impacts and Ethics Involving Computer Science and Society

*Programming and Software Engineering* (Grades 9-12):

This course is the concentrator course in the Software and System Development Pathway.  

Chico High School operates on a Block Schedule where students are in class for 1.5 hours every other day.  In a 2 week span, they will be in class 5 period for 7.5 hours.

Students learn modern programming basics using logic, pseudocode, flow charts, and storyboarding with programs such as Python. This course is designed to introduce students to math concepts in computer programming and data manipulation fundamentals. There is an emphasis on top down programming technique; syntax; documentation methods; modular, event oriented and object-oriented programming. Opportunity will be given to use 3D modeling in Blender and game design through Unity. Programming and Software Engineering experience is desired in most careers, even those outside of specific computer science fields, such as business, manufacturing, nursing, and law enforcement.
 
*Computing Impacts on Personal Lives and Society*

Throughout the course of each unit, students will be expected to read, reflect, and discuss topics (in small groups or as a class) about computing impacts on the daily lives of people and with the society they create.  The purpose of this is to encourage deeper levels of understanding about how programming, technology and computer science influences their life and society at large. As time in the course progresses, students will apply the skills they have learned from these topics to their own projects.


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

When beginning to learn about programming concepts, there are innumerable opportunities to work in the first four stages of Bloom’s Taxonomy: Remember, Understand, Apply and Analyze. As time and skill progress, they will elevate into the Evaluate and Create stages. One way to help students get into the frame of mind required to effectively work at those higher levels is to expose them to real world situations and consequences of events in programming, computer science and information technology.

### Learning Activities

The following article represents one of many similar articles that will be taken from archives or current events:

How 30 Lines of Code Blew Up a 27-Ton Generator - Wired Magazine

For every class cycle of 5 periods (approximately 2 weeks), students will be assigned to read a relevant article.  Using Lucid.app, Societal Impact Analysis, small groups of students work in small groups based on their workstations in the room (randomly shuffled at the start of each unit). In the 5th period, groups will share observations and related information that furthers the discussion.  


### Assessment

A minimum of 30 minutes of class time will be dedicated to the discussion. While the majority of this assignment will be graded as a group. Opportunities for individuals to stand out and earn additional point will be available.  

Using Google Classroom, a link will be provided to students to share and add to a class Lucid Document similar in nature to their group. Randomized group order for the first round of discussion. Subsequent questions should be voluntary, but a second round of randomly selected groups can be used if discussion slows.


### Outcomes

Computer Science is a field that is constantly reinventing itself.  There are basic concepts that underlie all that is done in the subject, but new ways of applying those concepts into content are constantly changing.  These assignments are designed to build off two main principles.
 
- They are challenging multifaceted problems that don’t necessarily have a single,  or even a “correct” solution, and can be philosophically in nature.
- They are current and relevant to the use of innovative technology, programming, computer science and information technology, testing their understanding of what that looks like
 
Some of these topics do not actually have to be about computer science, but base on the cultural or institutional environment surrounding the sector or industry. In this way students are also exposed to evaluating trends that they as future workers are going to potentially experience. Knowing that there are inequities based on gender, race or other minority status, helps prepare students to think of what they would do in those situations. Thinking about how seemingly small errors or omissions can lead to significant consequences down the line are important skills for people working on the forefront of developing technology.
